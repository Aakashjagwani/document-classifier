Subject to Secti on 18, the prohibitions set forth in this Section 15 shall remain \\n \\n \\n 12 \\n Eric Lannen - 6.24.15 Employment Agreement \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Exhibit 10.45 \\n \\n \\nin effect (i) for a period of two (2) years following the Termination Date for Retirement or any other reason other than (A) by the Executive for Good Reason or (B) by the Company other than for Cause, or (ii) for a period of six (6) months following the Termination Date for a termination (A) by the Executive for Good Reason or (B) by the Company for a reason other than Cause unless such termination is within 12 months following a Change of Control (in which case the foregoing restrictions shall not apply). \\n \\n 16.   Non-Competition Restrictions . \\n \\n(a) Executive hereby agrees that in order to protect the Company\\'s Secret and Confidential Information, it is necessary to enter into the following restrictive covenant, which is ancillary to the enforceable promise between the Company and Executive in Sections 11 through 15 of this Agreement. Executive hereby covenants and agrees that for the Employment Period, and (i) for a period of two (2) years following the Termination Date for Retirement or any other reason other than (A) by the Executive for Good Reason or (B) by the Company other than for Cause, or (ii) for a period of six (6) months following the Termination Date for a termination (A) by the Executive for Good Reason or (B) by the Company for a reason other than Cause unless such termination is within 12 months following a Change of Control (in which case the following restrictions shall not apply), Executive will not, directly or indirectly for Executive or for others (as a principal, agent, owner, employee, consultant or otherwise), in any county in the United States, or in any province in Canada, or otherwise within one hundred fifty (150) miles of where the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates are conducting any business as of the date of termination of Executive\\'s employment relationship or have conducted any business 12 months prior to the date of such termination (the \" Territory\"), including, but not limited to, the business of operating oil and gas pulling units or workover rigs, of completing or servicing, maintaining, or repairing oil and gas wells, removing, transporting, or disposing of liquid waste as produced therefrom, or of pressure pumping, rental and fishing tools or contract drilling: \\n \\n(l) engage in any business competitive with the business conducted by the Company or its affiliates or subsidiaries; \\n \\n(2) render advice or services to, or otherwise assist, any other person, association, or entity who is engaged, directly or indirectly, in any business competitive with the busines s conducted by the Company or its affiliates or subsidiaries; . \\n \\n(3) solicit business, or attempt to solicit business within the Territory, in products or services competitive with any products or services sold (or offered for sale) by the Company or any Affiliate, from the Company\\'s or Affiliate\\'s customers or prospective customers, or those individuals or entities with whom the Company or Affiliate did any business duri ng the two-year period ending on the Termination Date; or \\n \\n(4) testify as an expert witness in matters related to the Company\\'s business for an adverse party to the Company in litigation; provided, that nothing contained herein shall inter fere with Executive\\'s duty to testify as a witness if required by law; \\n \\n \\n \\n 13 \\n Eric Lannen - 6.24.15 Employment Agreement \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Exhibit 10.45 \\n \\n \\n provided, however, the foregoing and this Section shall not prohibit or be construed to prohibit Executive from owning less than 2% of any class of stock or other securities which are publicly traded on a national securities exchange or in a recognized over-the-counter market even if such entity or its Affiliates are engaged in competition with the Company or a subsidiary of  the Company. \\n \\n(b) Executive understands that the foregoing restrictions may limit Executive\\'s ability to engage in certain businesses during the periods provided for above, but acknowledges that Executive will receive sufficiently high remuneration and other benefits under this Agreement to justify such restriction. Executive acknowledges that money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Section 16 by Executive, and the Company shall be entitled to enforce the provisions of this Section 16 by terminating any payments then owing to Executive under this Agreement and/or to seek specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Section 16, but shall be in addition to all remedies available at law or in equity to the Company, including, without limitation, the recovery of damages from Executive and Executive\\'s agents involved in such breach. Executive further agrees to waive any requirement for the Company\\'s securing or posting of any bond in connection with su ch remedies. \\n \\n(c) It is expressly understood and agreed that the Company and Executive consider the restrictions contained in this Section 16 to be reasonable and necessary to protect the proprietary information of the Company. Nevertheless, if any of the aforesaid restrictions are found by a court having jurisdiction to be unreasonable, or overly broad as to geographic area or time, or otherwise unenforceable, the parties intend for the restrictions therein set forth to be modified by such courts so as to be reasonable and enforceable and, as so m odified by the court, to be fully enforced. \\n \\n(d) The covenants in this Section 16 are severable and separate, and the unenforceability of any specific covenant shall not affect the provisions of any other covenant. Moreover, in the event any court having jurisdiction shall determine that the scope, time or territorial restrictions set forth are unreasonable, then it is the intention of the parties that such restrictions be enforced to the fullest extent which the court deems reasonable, and the Agreement shall thereby be reformed. \\n \\n(e) All of the covenants in this Section 16 shall be construed as an agreement independent of any other provision in this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action of Executive against the Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of such covenants. It is specifically agreed that the period following termination of Executive\\'s employment, during which the agreements and covenants of Executive made herein shall be effective, shall be computed by excluding from such computation any time during which Executive is in material violation of any provision of this Section 16. \\n \\n \\n 17.   No-Recruitment Restriction. Executive agrees that during the Employment Period, and for a period of two (2) years from his Termination Date for whatever reason, Executive will not, either directly or indire ctly, or by acting in concert with others, solicit or influence or seek to \\n \\n \\n 14 \\n Eric Lannen - 6.24.15 Employment Agreement \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Exhibit 10.45 \\n \\n \\nsolicit or influence, any employee of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect him or his employment with the Company or any Affiliate. \\n \\n 18.   Tolling. If Executive violates any of the restrictions contained in Sections 11 through 17 of this Agreement, the restrictive period will be suspended and will not run in favor of Executive from the time of the commencement of any violation until the time when the Executive cures the violation to the Company\\'s reasonable satisfaction. \\n \\n 19.   Reformation. If a court or arbitrator concludes that any time period or the geographic area specified in any restrictive covenant in Sections 11 through 17 of this Agreement is unenforceable, then the time period will be reduced by the number of months, or the geographic area will be reduced by the elimination of such unenforceable portion, or both, so that the restric tions may be enforced in the geographic area and for the time to the full extent permitted by law. \\n \\n 20.   No Previous Restrictive Agreements. Executive represents that, except as disclosed in writing to the company, he is not bound by the terms of any agreement with any previous employer or other party to (a) refrain from using or disclosing any trade secret or confidential or proprietary information in the course of Executive\\'s employment by the Company or (b) refrain from competing, directly or indirectly, with the business of such previous employer or any other party. Executive further represents that his performance of all the terms of this Agreement and his work duties for the Company does not, and will not, breach any agreement to keep in confidence proprietary information, knowledge or data acquired by Executive in confidence or in trust prior to Executive\\'s employment with the Company, and Executive will not disclose to the Company or induce the Company to use any confidential or proprietary information or material b elonging to any previous employer or others. \\n \\n 21.   Conflicts of Interest. In keeping with his fiduciary duties to Company, Executive hereby agrees that he shall not become involved in a conflict of interest, or upon discovery thereof allow such a conflict to continue at any time during the Employment Period In this respect, Executive agrees to fully comply with the conflict of interest agreement entered into by Executive in his capacity as of an officer or director of the Company. In the instance of a material violation of the conflict of interest agreement to which Executive is a party, it may be necessa ry for Board to terminate Executive\\'s employment for Cause (as defined in   Section 6(d) );   provided, however, Executive cannot be terminated for Cause hereunder unless the Board first provides Executive with notice and an opportunity to cure such conflict of interest pursuant to the same  procedures as set forth in clause (E) of the definition of \"Cause\" in   Section 6(d) (2). \\n \\n 22.   Remedies. Executive acknowledges that the restrictions contained in Sections 11 through 21 of this Agreement, in view of the nature of the Company\\'s business, are reasonable and necessary to protect the Company\\'s legitimate business interests, and that any violation of this Agreement would result in irreparable injury to the Company. In the event of a breach or a threatened breach by Executive of any provision of Sections 11 through 21 of this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to a temporary restraining order and injunctive relief restraining Executive from the commission of any breach, and to recover the Company\\'s attorneys\\' fees, costs and expenses related to the breach or threatened breach. Nothing contained  in this Agreement shall be construed as \\n \\n \\n 15 \\n Eric Lannen - 6.24.15 Employment Agreement \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Exhibit 10.45 \\n \\n \\nprohibiting the Company from pursuing any other remedies available to it for any such breach or threatened breach, including, without limitation, the recovery of money damages, attorneys\\' fees, and costs. These covenants and disclosures shall each be construed as independent of any other provisions in this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action by Executive against the Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of such covenants and  agreements. \\n \\n 23.   Withholdings: Right of Offset. The Company may withhold and deduct from any benefits and payments made or to be made pursuant to this Agreement (a) all federal, state, local and other taxes may be required pursuant to any law or governmental regulation or ruling, (b) all other normal employee deductions made with respect to Company\\'s employees generally, and (c) any advances made to Exe cutive and owed to Company \\n \\n 24.   Nonalienation. The right to receive payments under this Agreement shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge or encumbrances by Executive, his dependents, or beneficiaries, or to any other person who is or may become entitled to receive such payments hereunder. The right to receive payments hereunder shall not be subject to or liable for the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person who is or may become entitled to receive such payments, nor may the same be subject to attachment or seizure by any creditor of such person under any circumstances, and any such attempted attachment or seizure shall be void and of no force and effect. \\n \\n 25.   Incompetent or Minor Payees. Should the Board or the Compensation Committee determine, in its discretion, that any person to whom any payment is payable under this Agreement has been determined to be legally incompetent or is a minor, any payment due hereunder, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, may be made in anyone or more of the following ways: (a) directly to such minor or person; (b) to the legal guardian or other duly appointed personal representative of this person or estate of such minor or person; or (c) to such adult or adults as have, in the good faith knowledge of the Board or the Compensation Committee, assumed custody and support of such minor or person; and any payment so made shall constitute full and complete discharge of any liability under this Agreement in respect to the amount paid. \\n \\n 26. [ Intentionally Omitted ]. \\n \\n 27.   Severability. It is the desire of the parties hereto that this Agreement be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law, and should any provision contained herein be held unenforceable by  a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator (pursuant to   Section 30), the parties hereby agree and consent that such provision shall be reformed to create a valid and enforceable provision to the maximum extent permitted by law;   provided, however, if such provision cannot be reformed, it shall be deemed ineffective and deleted herefrom without affecting any other provision of this Agreement. This Agreement should be construed by limiting and reducing it only to the minimum extent necessary to be enforceable under then applicable law. \\n \\n \\n \\n 16 \\n Eric Lannen - 6.24.15 Employment Agreement \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Exhibit 10.45 \\n \\n \\n 28.
