PURPOSE . \\n   \\n (a)                                   The purpose of the GTx, Inc. 2002 Stock Option Plan (the \" Plan\") is to provide a means by which selected key employees and directors (if declared eligible under paragraph 4) of and consultants to GTx, Inc. (the \" Company\"), and its Affiliates, as defined in subparagraph 1(b), may be given an opportunity to benefit from increases in value of the stock of the Company. It is intended that this purpose will be effected through the granting of (i) incentive stock options and/or, (ii) nonstatutory stock options. \\n   \\n (b)                                   The word \" Affiliate\" as used in the Plan means any parent corporation or subsidiary corporation of the Company, as those terms are defined in Sections 424 (e) and (f), respectively, of the Internal R evenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the \" Code \"). \\n   \\n (c)                                   The Company, by means of the Plan, seeks to retain the services of persons now employed by or serving as consultants or directors to the Company, to secure and retain the services of persons capable of filling such positions, and to provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company. \\n   \\n (d)                                   The Company intends that rights granted under the Plan (\" Option Awards \") shall, in the discretion of the Committee or Board of Directors of the Company (the \" Board\"), as applicable, be either (i) incentive stock options as that term is used in Section 422 of the Code (\" Incentive Stock Options \"), or (ii) stock options which do not qualify as Incentive Stock Options (\" Supplemental Stock Options \"). \\n   \\n 2.                                         ADMINISTRATION. \\n   \\n (a)                                  The Plan shall be administered by a Committee appointed by the Board of Directors of the Company composed of not fewer than three (3) Directors (the \" Committee \"). \\n   \\n (b)                                  The Committee shall have the power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan and to such resolutions, not inconsistent with the provisions of  the Plan, as may be adopted from time to time by the Board of Directors: \\n   \\n (i)                                     To determine from time to time which of the persons eligible under the Plan shall be granted Option Awards; when and how Option Awards shall be granted; whether a Option Award will be an Incentive Stock Option, a Supplemental Stock Option, or a combination of the foregoing; and the provisions of each Option Award granted (which need not be identical). \\n   \\n (ii)                                 To construe and interpret the Plan and Option Awards granted under it, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its administration. The Committee, in the exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any Option Award, in a manner and to the extent it shall deem necessary or expedient to make  the Plan fully effective, consistent with its terms. \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n (iii)                              To amend the Plan as provided in paragraph 10. \\n   \\n (iv)                              Generally, to exercise such powers and to perform such acts as the Committee deems necessary or expedient to promote the best interests of the Company. \\n   \\n (c)                                   The Board of Directors may abolish the Committee at any time and revest in the Board of Directors the administration of the Plan. \\n   \\n 3.                                         SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN. \\n   \\n (a)                                  Subject to the provisions of paragraph 9 relating to adjustments upon changes in stock, the stock that may be issued pursuant to Option Awards granted under the Plan shall not exceed in the aggregate Ten Thousand (10,000) shares of the Company\\'s common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of shareholder approval of the Plan. If any option or right granted under the Plan shall for any reason expire or otherwise terminate without having been exercised in full, the stock not issued under such option or right shall again become av ailable for the Plan. \\n   \\n (b)                                  The stock subject to the Plan may be unissued shares or reacquired shares, bought on the market or otherwise. \\n   \\n 4.                                         ELIGIBILITY. \\n   \\n (a)                                  Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees (including officers) of the Company or its Affiliates.

TERMS OF STOCK OPTIONS . \\n   \\nEach stock option shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board or the Committee shall deem appropriate. All options shall be separately designated \\n   \\nIncentive Stock Options or Supplemental Stock Options at the time of grant, and in such form as issued pursuant to this paragraph, and a separate certificate or certificates shall be issued for shares purchased on exercise of each type of option. An option designated as a Supplemental Stock Option shall not be treated as an Incentive Stock Option. The provisions of separate options need not be identical, but each option shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the option or otherwise) the substance of  each of the following provisions: \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n (a)                                  The term of any option shall not be greater than ten (10) years from the date it was granted or, in the case of any option contemplated by paragraph 4(b), five (5) years from the  date of grant. \\n   \\n (b)                                  The exercise price of each Incentive Stock Option shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value of the stock subject to the option on the date the option is granted or, in the case of any option contemplated by paragraph 4(b), one hundred ten percent (110%) of the fair market value of the stock subject to the option on the date  of grant of the option. \\n   \\n (c)                                   The purchase price of stock acquired pursuant to an option shall be paid, to the extent permitted by applicable statutes and regulations, either (i) in cash at the time the option is exercised, or (ii) at the discretion of the Committee either at the time of the grant or exercise of the option, (A) by delivery to the Company of other common stock of the Company, (B) according to a deferred payment or other arrangement (which may include, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of other common stock of the Company) with the person to whom the option is granted or to whom the option is transferred pursuant to subparagraph 5(d), or (C) in any other form of legal consideration that may be accepta ble to the Committee. \\n   \\n (d)                                    (i)                                     Unless otherwise expressly stated in the option, an option shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the person to whom the option is granted only by such person, nor shall an option holder have the right or power to anticipate, accelerate, convey, assign or otherwise alienate, hypothecate, pledge or otherwise encumber any option award or the shares subject to an option award. \\n   \\n (ii)                                 Except with respect to Incentive Stock Options, the Committee may, in its discretion, establish forms and procedures for the transfer of all or any portion of such Option Award by the optionee to (i) Immediate Family Members (as defined hereinafter), (ii) a trust or trusts for the exclusive benefit of the optionee and such Immediate Family Members, or (iii) a partnership or limited liability company in which the optionee and such Immediate Family Members are the only partners or members (collectively such optionee\\'s \" Permitted Transferees\"), provided that subsequent transfers shall be prohibited except in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution, or by will. Notification and approval of all such transfers shall be in the form specified by the Committee. Following transfer, any such Option Award shall continue to be subject to the  same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to transfer, provided that for purposes of this Plan, wherever appropriate, the term \" optionee\" shall be deemed to refer to the Permitted Transferee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan Committee and the Company shall have no obligation to inform any Permitted Transferee of any expiration, termination, lapse or acceleration of any such Option Award and may give notices required hereunder, if any, to the optionee. The events of termination of employment hereof shall continue to be applied with respect to the original optionee, following which the Option Award shall be exercisable by the Permitted Transferee only to the exte nt, and for the periods specified herein. As used herein \" Immediate Family Member\" shall mean, with respect to the optionee, his or her spouse, child, stepchild, grandchildren or other descendants, and shall include relationships arising from legal adoption. \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n (e)                                   The total number of shares of stock subject to an option may, but need not, be allotted in periodic installments (which may, but need not, be equal). From time to time during each  of such installment periods, the option may become exercisable (\" vest\") with respect to some or all of the shares allotted to that period, and may be exercised with respect to some or all of the shares allotted to such period and/or any prior period as to which the option was not fully exercised. During the remainder of the term of the option (if its term extends beyond the end of the installment periods), the option may be exercised from time to time with respect to any shares then remaining subject to the option. In the absence of a specific provision to the contrary in a particular option grant, an option award shall vest one-third (1/3) on the third anniversary of the date of grant of such option award, an additional one-third on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant of such option award, and the final one-third (1/3) shall vest on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant of such option award. The provisions of this subparagraph 5(e) are subject to any option provisions governing the minimum number of shares as to which an option may be exercised. \\n   \\n (f)                                    An option shall terminate three (3) months after termination of the optionee\\'s employment or relationship as a director of or consultant to the Company or an Affiliate, unless (i) such termination is due to such person\\'s permanent and total disability, within the meaning of Section 422(c)(6) of the Code, in which case the option may, but need not, provide that it may be exercised at any time within one (1) year following such termination of employment or relationship as a director or consultant; or (ii) the optionee dies while in the employ of or while serving as a director of or consultant to the Company or an Affiliate, or within not more than three (3) months after termination of such relationship, in which case the option may, but need not, provide that it may be exercised at any time within eighteen (18) months following the death of the optionee by the person or persons to whom the optionee\\'s rights under such option passes by will or by the laws of descent and distribution; or (iii) such termination is due to such person\\'s voluntary retirement in accordance with subparagraph (h) below, in which case the option may be exercised at any time within the earlier of five (5) years from the date of termination of such employment or relationship, as the case may be, or the term of the option; or (iv) the option by its terms specifies either (a) that it shall terminate sooner than three (3) months after termination of the optionee\\'s employment or relationship as a director or consultant, or (b) that it may be exercised more than three (3) months after termination of the optionee\\'s employment or relationship with the Company or an Affiliate. This subparagraph 5(f) shall not be construed to extend the term of any option or to permit anyone to exercise the option after expiration of its term, nor shall it be construed to increase the number of shares as to which any option is exercisable from the amount exercisable on the date of termination of the o ptionee\\'s employment or relationship as a consultant or director. \\n   \\n (g)                                  Prior to such time as the Company\\'s shares of common stock are first sold to the public in an offering registered pursuant to Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ( \" Initial Public Offering\"), any shares of stock acquired through the exercise of an option shall be subject to a thirty (30) day right of first refusal by the Company at the same price and terms as offered by any third party pursuant to a bona fide offer, and may not be sold prior to an offer to sell to the Company on such terms. Further, shares acquired through exercise of an option award shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Voting and Shareholder Agreement dated October 5, 2001, between the Company and its stockholders,  as amended from time to time (the \" Stockholders Agreement \"). \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n (h)                                  In the event of a participant\\'s termination of employment or service as a director, as applicable, by reason of voluntary retirement (at or after age sixty-five (65) or after age fifty-five with no fewer than five (5) years of service), death, permanent and total disability, involuntary termination (other than a termination for cause but including any involuntary termination as the result of a Change in Control, as addressed below), with respect to such participant\\'s Option Award(s), the Committee may in its sole, absolute and final  discretion elect to vest any or all shares not otherwise vested under the terms of the Plan. \\n   \\nFor purposes of this section, a permanent and total disability shall mean (A) the inability of the optionee to perform substantially all of his or her duties and responsibilities to the Company by reason of a physical or mental disability or infirmity (excluding, however, infrequent and temporary absences due to ordinary illness) (i) for a continuous period of more than ninety (90) days or (ii) at such time as the optionee submits satisfactory medical evidence that he or she has a permanent physical or mental disability or infirmity which will likely prevent him from returning to the performance of his work duties for more than ninety (90) days, and (B) either the optionee or the Company shall have given the other at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of intent to terminate employment. The date of such permanent and total disability shall be on the last day of such ninety (90) day period or the day on which the optionee submits such satisfactory medical evidence, as the case might be. \\n   \\nFor purposes of this section, a termination for cause shall mean the termination of an individual\\'s status as an employee or director of the Company, as applicable, as the result of (i) fraud or dishonesty in connection with the business of the Company; (ii) gross negligence in the performance of duties for the Company; (iii) willful failure in carrying out duties as an employee, director or consultant; or (iv) arrest and conviction of a felony involving moral turpitude, whether or not in connection with the business of the Company; provided that (iii) above shall not apply if the Option Award holder has been assigned by the Company to duties which are not comparable to such holder\\'s function and compensation at the Company, or which are non-executive or demeaning assignments, or if the Company has given such participant demeaning and unreasonable pay cuts. \\n   \\n (i)                                     In the event of a Change in Control of the Company, all shares subject to all Option Awards shall become one hundred percent (100%) vested and shall be converted to cash, options or stock of equivalent value in the surviving organization under terms and condition which substantially preserve the economic status of the Participants, as determined by the Comm ittee. For purposes of this paragraph, a Change in Control shall mean: \\n   \\n(a) The sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company in a single transaction or in a series of transactions (including, without limitation, any liquidation or dissolution of the Company); (b) the sale or other disposition of more than fifty percent (50%) of the issued and outstanding voting stock of the Company, in a single transaction or in a series of transactions; or (c) a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into any other entity, if immediately after giving effect to such transaction more than fifty percent (50%) of the issued and outstanding voting stock of the surviving entity of such transaction is held by persons who were not holders (taking into account their individual and affiliated holdings) as of the date of the grant of this Option of at least 20% of the voting stock of the Company. For such purposes, \" voting stock \" shall mean the capital stock of the Company of any class or classes, the holders of \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\nwhich are ordinarily, in the absence of contingencies, entitled to vote for the election of members of the Board of Directors (or Persons performing similar functions) of the Compa ny. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a \" Change in Control\" shall not include: (i) any transfer or issuance of stock of the Company to one or more of the Company\\'s lenders (or to any agents or representatives thereof) in exchange for debt of the Company owed to any such lenders; (ii) any transfer of stock of the Company to or by any person or entity, including but not limited to one or more of the Company\\'s lenders (or to any agents or representatives thereof), pursuant to the terms of any pledge of said stock as collateral for any loans or financial accommodations to the Company and/or its subsidiaries; (iii) any transfer or issuance to any person or entity, including but not limited to one or more of the Company\\'s lenders (or to any agents or representatives thereof), in connection with the workout or restructuring of the Company\\'s debts to any one of the Company\\'s lenders, including but not limited to the issuance of new stock in exchange for any equity contribution to the Company in connection with the workout or restructuring of such debt; or (iv) any transfer of stock by a stockholder of the Company which is a part nership or corporation to the partners or stockholders in such stockholder. \\n   \\n (j)                                     In the event of an Initial Public Offering of the Company, Option Awards shall be convertible to options in shares of the newly public company, under terms and  conditions which substantially preserve the rights and options of the participant. Any resulting registration of options or shares shall be effected at Company expense. \\n   \\n (k)                                  If provided in the Option Award, each Option Award shall carry the right to receive any dividend or dividend equivalent on vested shares, under such terms and conditions as may be  specified in the Option Award. \\n   \\n (l)                                     Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, any vested but unexercised Option Award shares shall be forfeited upon the Option Award holder\\'s \" Competition\" with the Company. For this purpose, Competition shall be determined by the Committee, and shall exist if the Option Award holder while employed by or consulting for the Company and for a period of two (2) years thereafter directly or indirectly (i) engages or has a financial interest in, (ii) becomes an officer, employee, director, partner, advisor or consultant of or to, (iii) has an equity interest in, or (iv) in any way materially assists any person, corporation, entity or business whose existing or planned products or activities compete in whole or in part with the existing or planned products or activities of the Company.
